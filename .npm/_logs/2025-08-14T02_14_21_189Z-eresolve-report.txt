# npm resolution error report

While resolving: zitouna-tamkeen-app@0.0.0
Found: date-fns@4.1.0
node_modules/date-fns
  date-fns@"^4.1.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer date-fns@"^2.28.0 || ^3.0.0" from react-day-picker@8.10.1
node_modules/react-day-picker
  react-day-picker@"8.10.1" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
